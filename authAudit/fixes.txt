fixes needed:

Major:
1) Timestamp:
        - do per event not batched. 
        - format - string, utc with a z. (timezone) 
2) One event per line - bring it into the for loop. 
3) Change append-only logging. 

External input option:
    - default attempts list as backup.
    cli args for: 
        -- input - choose the input file to use. 

headers for fields

auto-increment event-ids 

Others:
- break into small readable functions
- fix imports 
- Use a context manager for the file (close it!)
- user 999 problem - flag to say known/unknown user.
- clean up prints
- docstrings, comments, full - annotations. 
- naming conventions. 
- improve readability.  
- team name added to log??? 
- change language to more professional. 
- file object improvements. 
- Ensure main loop runs in a run guard (doesnt when imported)


basic validation on input data. 
simple error handling. 

Think about exit codes.
